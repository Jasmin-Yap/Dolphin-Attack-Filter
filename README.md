# Dolphin-Attack-Filter
Using Nyquist language, a GUI-based plugin for audio recording and editing application Audacity will be implemented to serve as a filter for audio inputs using the high pass and low pass functions. For consumers, this means that the audio files can be sanitized for inaudible sound payloads embedded within. For digital forensics investigators, the reverse can be performed; the audible sounds can be filtered off from the audio file to extract evidence, i.e. inaudible voice messages. For people with secrets, the plugin can change the frequency of their audio files to hide their messages in different audio files.
